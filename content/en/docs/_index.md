  **CDAP** provides developers with data and application abstractions to simplify and accelerate application development, address a broader range of real-time and batch use cases, and deploy applications into production quicker while satisfying enterprise requirements. 


  CDAP runs of Apache Hadoop distributions such as Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub, the Hortonworks Data Platform, or the MapR Distribution. It also supports all the major public clouds such as AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. CDAP exposes developer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for creating applications and accessing core CDAP services. CDAP defines and implements a diverse collection of services that support applications and data on existing Hadoop infrastructure such as HBase, HDFS, YARN, MapReduce, Hive, and Spark. 


  In addition, CDAP also provides built-in applications that solve vertical industry use-cases such data preparation, integration, metadata management and machine learning.
